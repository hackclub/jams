Whether you have programmed your whole life or this is your very first project, there is plenty of fun to be had with creating a Choose Your Own Adventure Game (CYOA)! This build incorporates music, interactive elements, and the ability to control all stylistic features! The most important part is to use your imagination since there is no limit to what YOU can create! No matter what difficulty you choose, you will have a playable game fit to share with family, and friends, and publish! You will gain invaluable knowledge in Python which you can use to create more games or implement in other projects!

## What Will We Use?

- We will be using an online coding platform called ***Replit***. It provides a browser based integrated development environment (IDE), which allows users to write, run, and collaborate on programs with support multiple programming languages! The best part? It is available on *ALL* devices!

Here is Replit's Documentation for future Reference: https://docs.replit.com/

- We will also be using ***Python*** to complete this project! Any familiarity with the language is recommended but *not* required!

1. Simplicity and Readability: Python's syntax is best known for its readability and simplicity making it a great option for beginners and those who would like a more straightforward language. 
2. Beginner Friendly: Python's syntax resembles natural language. This allows users to focus on programming concepts more than complex syntax. 
3. Rapid Development and Prototyping: Python's focus on code simplicity and the availability of powerful libraries allow users to quickly prototype and iterate on ideas.
