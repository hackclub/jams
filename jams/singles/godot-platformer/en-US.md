# Build a Godot Platformer Game

You’ll build a 2D game with a character that can run and jump around. You will use [Godot](https://godotengine.org/), a game engine. This is for [Jumpstart](https://daydream.jumpstart.hackclub.com/), a Hack Club You Ship We Ship.

## Overview of Steps
- Setup Godot
- Install Hackatime
- Make a Github repo
- Build a basic platformer
- Customize your game
- Publish on Itch.io
- Submit your game

By the end, you will have an AWESOME, UNIQUE game to share to your friends! You'll also know the basics of using [Github](https://github.com/), [Hackatime](https://hackatime.hackclub.com/), and [Itch](https://itch.io/). If you have any questions or problems, ask in the [#jumpstart-daydream](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C098A4657FT) channel in Hack Club Slack or DM [@magic frog](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U06UYA4AH6F).


## Setup Godot
[Godot](https://godotengine.org/) is a free, open source game engine. Game engines are used to make games easily! Go to [godotengine.org](https://godotengine.org/) to install it. If you cannot install it, you can also use the web editor at [editor.godotengine.org](https://editor.godotengine.org/releases/latest/).
