## Introduction

Welcome to Oscillart! My name‚Äôs Celeste, and I‚Äôm a 16-year old Hack Clubber from Atlanta, Georgia. I‚Äôm gonna be helping you through this Jam, which was created as a guided project for the Athena Awards.

This project allows you to combine art, music, and computer science together to create your own web app using Javascript. When you type in the notes to your favorite song, your web app will create art and play music using the sine waves that depict the frequencies of those notes! You‚Äôll make something that looks like this below:

![Demo gif](https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/290e71abdd7c64ea5e31b2a70ae02f5ed8027e27_demo__1_.gif)

What‚Äôs more? You‚Äôll be able to add unique user inputs that allow you to customize your art and music every time you run it! You‚Äôre like your own technological DJ. Then, when you‚Äôve created a song you love, you can record it straight from the web app (and upload it to the gallery on [oscillart.athena.hackclub.com](oscillart.athena.hackclub.com)).
<br />

## Context

But hold on, what even are sine waves? And why are we using them to write songs? Let‚Äôs go full physics-mode for a sec (bear with me üòÅ).

![Gif of sine waves](https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/e3a1fb0f9f3c25f0a986f0d9a6631747d1cb7b05_gif.gif)

So, you see the waves above? When sound waves travel through the air, a pure tone moves the air in the same way that this sine wave travels: air vibrating, and thus compressing. At the top of the wave, that‚Äôs when the air pressure is highest. At the bottom of the wave, that‚Äôs when the air pressure is lowest. How high/low the wave goes - that‚Äôs called the amplitude. It controls how loud or soft the sound is.

There‚Äôs way more to learn about acoustics, but all you really need to understand is that **a sine wave is the mathematical depiction of a pure tone**. Thus, when we tell our computer to play that pure tone, we‚Äôre telling it to activate the speakers according to a sine wave!

## Jam Layout

This jam is laid out in **6 main parts (excluding intro)** (including deployment). Each part should take about an hour to complete, meaning if you‚Äôre running this through a Hack Club, you‚Äôll probably wanna dedicate at least 6 club meetings to this project. If you‚Äôre doing this on your own, this YSWS should take about 6 hours. The parts will include:

1. Using sine-wave frequencies to play sounds from our computer
2. Drawing those sine-waves on the Javascript canvas
3. Going through multiple notes and writing songs
4. Adding in user input to customize your music
5. Recording your submissions
6. Deploying the app (and earning artifacts for the Athena Award!)

Throughout this whole jam, I want to give as much help as possible while still letting you be creative! This jam expects you to have a **beginner knowledge of programming itself** (for example: you know what an if-statement is, you know what a loop is, etc.) but doesn‚Äôt require any knowledge of Javascript or any of the APIs we're gonna be using. In addition, a basic knowledge of music might be helpful (like knowing what the notes on the scale are) but is not required. :)

If you get stuck, that‚Äôs totally fine!! Check out **#athena-award**, **#oscillart**, **#code**, or even dm me at **@thegrammarpolice**. I‚Äôd be happy to hop on a call or message with you while you figure it out. 

That said, if you have some more coding or Javascript experience, I totally encourage you to do this jam - and go above and beyond! üöÄ Throughout the Jam, there will be dropdowns with extra challenges. These challenges were often inspired by you all asking questions during **#oscillart** calls or slack parties, so if the challenge was inspired by someone‚Äôs question or exploration, I‚Äôll give them credit.

Remember, to get your submission approved, your site must do the following:
1. Play music based on user-inputted notes
2. Create art based on user-inputted notes
3. Allow for user input in addition to typing in notes (think‚Ä¶ changing volume, changing color of the waves, etc.) for both music *and* art elements
4. Add at least one personal touch that is not in this tutorial :)

And that‚Äôs it! Let‚Äôs get started, shall we?
<br />

## Setup

We‚Äôre going to be coding our site in GitHub Codespaces, which is completely free and completely online - so no downloading software required. To do this, you need a GitHub account. If you don‚Äôt have one yet, go to [Github.com](https://github.com/) and create one! It‚Äôs super easy.

Now that you‚Äôre logged into your GitHub account, let‚Äôs create a repository. A repository is where you can store code online, so that other people can view it (and/or make changes to it if you‚Äôre collaborating on a project.)

![Github landing screen](https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/beec85a11cf61f5b7817d0c8d7dd2a3bbb966bfa_screenshot_2025-06-06_at_11.51.12___am.png)

Click the button on the top left of your screen that says ‚ÄúNew Repository‚Äù.

![Create repository](https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/5a1eec76aa9e7289ec092df57a8110ddcc9129d5_screenshot_2025-06-06_at_11.51.50___am.png)

Enter a name, description, make sure it‚Äôs a public repo, click the ‚ÄúAdd a ReadMe‚Äù checkbox (we‚Äôll deal with that later), and you don‚Äôt need a license for now.

![New blank repository with codespace button](https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/ce61ee5229467a67054a0891acc2439efe25fae9_screenshot_2025-06-06_at_11.52.24___am.png)

Congrats on creating your repository! Now, click the green button on the left that says ‚ÄúCode‚Äù, click to the rightmost tab that pops up that says ‚ÄúCodespaces‚Äù, and finally hit the plus button. 

![Codespaces blank open](https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/17a5cf57a782ddb549bb6d65d9bd4a271081387d_screenshot_2025-06-06_at_11.52.56___am.png)

Then, click on the name of your codespace. This is where you‚Äôre gonna do all your programming!

One last thing: to edit your site in real-time, before you‚Äôve fully deployed it, we‚Äôre going to use an extension called **Live Server**. In Codespaces, go to the left and click the extensions button.

![Live server extension selected](https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/0430e210f2b91644e0dd63cd9331b629ce9db3fb_screenshot_2025-06-06_at_11.53.17___am.png)

Then, search for Live Server, click on it, and hit install

Now, at the bottom right of your screen, you should see a button in your toolbar that says ‚ÄúGo Live‚Äù. Don‚Äôt press it yet, but when you have some code, you‚Äôll press it to be redirected to a preview of your site!
<br />

## Athena Awards and Hackatime

If you are doing this project for the **Athena Awards**, you have to set up **Hackatime** on your Codespaces environment, so that you can earn artifacts for each hour you spend coding. Luckily, Codespaces is identical to Visual Studio Code, so I will link [the instructions for installing Hackatime for VSCode](https://hackatime.hackclub.com/docs/editors/vs-code) and you should be able to follow those exactly. (To set up Hackatime for Codespaces, **follow the instructions for Mac/Linux**, even if you're using a Windows device!)

Note - because Codespaces is online, after you install Hackatime and the Wakatime extension, you may have to wait a few minutes, and then refresh the Codespaces browser. When you see a clock in the bottom left corner of your toolbar, like this:

![Hackatime-ready toolbar in VSCode](https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/717164df1373f666887ed3faefb3df68b29f73a2_screenshot_2025-06-06_at_11.48.28___am.png)

Even if the clock says 0 minutes or ‚Äústart coding to get started‚Äù, then you have successfully installed Hackatime!
